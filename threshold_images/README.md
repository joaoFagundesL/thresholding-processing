# How to use it

### Compile

Using `make` will compile the program with all required files and
with some useful flags.

### Run

The program takes three arguments

1. ./main (compiled file)
2. path to the grayscale image
3. desired path to save the image with the name to save

**Example**

```bash
./main ./original_images/moca.pgm ./threshold_image/moca.pgm
```

**the dot in the path just indicates the current dir**
